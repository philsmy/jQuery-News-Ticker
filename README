---------

Forked to allow:

* More than one instance on a page (everything is now classes and uses the parent's id)

Reload the content 
------------------

We are stuffing our content into the list items using javascript, so we needed a way to reload them. This is done by creating a new 'reload' control (our controls are hidden) and then clicking on it:

    if (need_reload) {
      jQuery('#news_'+this.idx+'-reload').click();
    };
